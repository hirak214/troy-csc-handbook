This folder contains an archive of the original per-topic chapter folders that were duplicated by the consolidated `handbook/` content.

Why archived:
- The site navigation (`mkdocs.yml`) uses the `handbook/` files as the canonical published content.
- The numbered folders (e.g. `01_overview/`, `02_operations/`, etc.) contained duplicate or empty files and caused contributor confusion.

What we did:
- Moved the original folders into this archive to preserve history and make the repository cleaner.
- If you want to restore any file, copy it back from this archive into the repo root.

If you prefer a different approach (delete instead of archive, or merge specific files into `handbook/`), reply and I will adjust.
