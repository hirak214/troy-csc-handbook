Canonical content for this repository lives under the `handbook/` directory and is what the site publishes (see `mkdocs.yml`).

What changed in this cleanup step:
- I created `archive/duplicate-pages/` and copied the original per-topic files into it to preserve them.
- I did not delete the original per-topic folders (left them in place). If you want me to delete them, reply "Delete originals" and I'll remove them after creating backups in the archive.

Recommended workflow for contributors:
1. Edit files under `handbook/` for any content changes.
2. If you must add a new page, add it to `handbook/` and update `mkdocs.yml`.
3. If you prefer a split multi-page structure, let me know and I'll update `mkdocs.yml` and move files accordingly.

If you'd like me to proceed with deleting original numbered folders now, reply: "Delete originals". If you want them moved instead, reply: "Move originals to archive and delete".
